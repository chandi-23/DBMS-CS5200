## R Analysis of Restaurant Visits

We recorded a total number of __ visits across __ different restaurants from ____ to ____. The average amount spent for a visit across all restaurants is ___ (σ = ___). The most visits were at ______ while the largest revenue across all years was at ______. The average size of a party was ___ and __% of all parties consumed wine.

       AVG(cleaned_amount) AS avg_revenue
FROM combined_data
GROUP BY restaurant
"

# Execute the query using sqldf
revenue_summary <- sqldf(revenue_summary_query)

# Display the revenue summary table
kable(revenue_summary)

# Display the content of revenue_summary
print(revenue_summary)
